title: WTF is a digital garden?
---
**Welcome to my digital garden.**

These notes are primarily written for myself,
Most notes are incomplete, works in progress that will be tended over time. Some notes may have missing references, as these notes are taken straight from my [[Noteplan]] notebook I spend a lot of my working day.

There is no hierarchy to these notes. All notes are interlinked - click around and choose your own adventure. You could start by reading about [[What has my attention right now]] or [[cats]] or .

Here are all the notes in this garden, along with their links, visualised as a graph:
