- Process > Performance
	- Showing up and putting in reps is more important than the end result
- Writing it down
	- Increases cognitive understanding and long term retention
	- Forcing you to capture the data in own words (better recall)
	- This saves time in the long run (See: Writing can save you time, David Perrell)
- Back to basics
	- Master the basics before complex
- Verablise
	- Requires you to re-word on the fly
	- Complexity and jargon are used to mask a lack of understanding
	- ELI5 test  
- Gamification
	- Gameify the fuck out of your learning
- Interleaving
	- Mix multiple topics together whilst studying
	- Keeps the mind engaged
- Need to do hard things to learn
	- Brain reacts to pressure and stress
